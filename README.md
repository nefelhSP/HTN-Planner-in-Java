# Java HTN Barman Solver: A Purpose-Built Planner for IPC 2023
This project is a Java-based solver developed for the IPC 2023 Barman domain in the HTN Total-Order track. The entire HTN domain model is implemented directly in code, allowing a controlled and transparent environment for exploring hierarchical task decomposition, ordering constraints, and search-based plan generation. Built as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Applied Informatics at the University of Macedonia (UoM), the project investigates how structured HTN models and guided planning techniques can work together to produce valid primitive action sequences in a complex, domain-rich planning scenario. It aims to provide a clear, modular foundation for understanding and experimenting with HTN planning in Java while demonstrating practical methods for solving real competition-level planning tasks.
