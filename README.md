# HTN_Planning
In my bachelor’s thesis, I build a Java-based solver for the IPC 2023 Barman HTN domain (total-order). The domain is fully encoded in my code, and my solver breaks down complex tasks, follows their required order, and searches efficiently for a valid sequence of actions to solve each planning problem.
